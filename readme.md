### GDS046 Web Design & Web Development 2
# September 14, 2020

I finished my first project for the class. It was so that we had the chance to refresh our skills (I needed it) and dig deep into the bare-bone-basics of HTML and CSS without having to use external library sources like Bootstrap or Materialize to compose the page. I must say, it took me a bit to start warming up. I felt rusty. However, after some time, everything started to click into place, and it made the process smoother. 

There were two parts of the project: the first week focused on the orientation for the class. We had to create a one-page biography site. To start, we needed to use Figma to mock-up a wireframe. Following the second week, the project had to be completed with all the bare essentials that went into a webpage: HTML and CSS.
